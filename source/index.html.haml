      Some notes:
      * gap: is required only on iOS (when using UIWebView) and is needed for JS->native communication
      * https://ssl.gstatic.com is required only on Android and is needed for TalkBack to function properly
      * Disables use of inline scripts in order to mitigate risk of XSS vulnerabilities. To change this:
      * Enable inline JS: add 'unsafe-inline' to default-src
    %meta{content: "default-src 'self' data: gap: https://ssl.gstatic.com 'unsafe-eval'; style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'; media-src *", "http-equiv" => "Content-Security-Policy"}/
